## programming exercises in C and its respective PRACTICAL WORK based on a real problem of an E-Commerce chocolate shop, Cost Analysis and Programming

#### We are hired to develop software for a chocolate organization, to manage the distribution of finished products. The company's needs are logistics in search of distribution cost optimization.A freight company must be selected to distribute the chocolates over a total distance between 400 and 600 km, their shipments are by prior and daily orders, with a minimum weight of 500 gr and a maximum of 2 kg and within a period of Delivery within 48 hours at most. It may happen that the input values may vary over time and that the company expands the production line to market another product.
### Procedure:
#### 1. Contact at least three companies to survey rates and their characteristics. (we do not initially give a statement, they must communicate with the source of information, via the Internet). Example Correo Argentino, Andreani Encomienda
#### 2. Analyze the information obtained in the survey.
#### 3. Design the tables (2 columns) for each company surveyed, independent variable (x): unit weight (kg) or distance (km) and the dependent variable (y): cost ($).
#### 4. Create the mathematical model that responds to the different tables.
#### 5. Graph in Geogebra the functions of the mathematical model (4) with the same variables x and y according to the company.
#### 6. Make inferences and conclusions from the graphs, which is the most convenient company for you to carry out freight, to minimize costs.
#### 7. Analysis, Design and implementation in C language to calculate the cost of a package, taking into account the chosen transportation, distance, weight and time.
